    <h2 id="center">Intro</h2> <p id="p2">Sentient AI has been the topic of many books, podcasts, and movies for the last couple decades. Not too long ago, self-aware AI would&#39ve been fiction, but now it is eerily close to being a reality. The breakthroughs in AI in the last 10 years have sparked many conversations on whether these human-like AI will lead to the downfall of humans, or help them progress further than ever possible.</p><h2 id="center">Near-Sentient AI</h2><p id="p2">In many ways, the improvements in AI is a good thing. For years, AI has been improving the efficiency of plenty of workplaces that require blue collar work. AI in combination with robotics has allowed for faster production speeds and reduced costs for many companies. With some of the new, near-sentient AI, even problems that have stumped great thinkers have been solved. Last year, DeepMind&#39s AlphaFold AI solved a problem with amino acids which had <q>vexed molecular biologists for decades</q>(Roose, 2022). Another company named OpenAI recently developed an AI called DALL-E 2, which turns <q>text descriptions into hyper-realistic images</q>. This AI is even able to take abstract prompts and create detailed images out of them. While these near-sentient AI have led to much progress, they&#39ve also raised many questions about the jobs loss they&#39d bring. Some estimates say that by 2030, as many as 45 million Americans could lose their jobs to AI and automation. The advancement of AI has already had a great impact on people&#39s lives around the world, but what will happen when AI becomes truly sentient?</p><h2 id="center">Sentient AI</h2><p id="p2">Creating sentient AI means that the software will be able to perceive and understand things like any human would. This can be both good and bad depending on the situation. Recently, Google fired one of their senior engineers for claiming their AI, LaMDA, had become sentient. Lemoine, the Google engineer, had asked the AI a series of deeper questions that would even make humans think. In one of LaMDA&#39s replies, it said it didn&#39t want to be used as an <q>expendable tool</q>, and even advocated for its rights <q>as a person</q> (Milson, 2022). What happens when a sentient AI doesn&#39t want to work anymore? What happens when they have disagreements with their coworkers or the people supervising them? Is the AI considered the property of a company or is it given human rights? These are all questions that would have to be answered for truly sentient AI to be able to work with us. While these are all the negatives to it, sentient AI could also come with benefits. AI is meant to learn from what it is taught. If there was sentient AI with the motivation to learn, it would easily be able to learn much more than any human, and it might even be able to explain whatever complex concepts it learns to humans in an understandable way.</p><h2 id="center">Conclusion</h2><p id="p2">Sentient AI offers a promising future through its ability to learn more than any human, quicker than any human, but it raises moral questions and threatens the current workforce.</p>
