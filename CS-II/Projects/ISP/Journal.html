      <b><p>Project Manager:</p></b>
      <p>Project managers have the job of planning and organizing projects while taking into account certain budgets, time constraints, and team members' abilities. In our case, the project manager is going to be overseeing the production of the Cafe Project. They will have to assign a portion of the work to each of the team members and make sure they get it done in a timely manner to have the app working by late April. I think I could be a good fit for this position because I have good organizational skills. Last year, I broke up my ISP project into pieces and completed at least one piece per week. This allowed me to finish the project early and have extra time to fix minor problems. One of the problems I expect to encounter is having to code about something we haven't learned about. In that case, I would assign research time to the team so that we could figure out a way to work through it or work around the problem.</p>

      <b><p>Product Manager:</p></b>
      <p>Product managers are the people in charge of the product from the beginning to the end. They are the ones who plan how the product is going to work, direct updates to the product, and make sure the customer's needs are being met. On our ISP, the product manager is going to be in charge of coming up with the ideas for the products features and working with the rest of the team to get said features developed. They will also have to be involved with the testing and determine what could be done better. I think I would struggle in this position because I have never been very creative. I think a good way for me to come up with ideas for good features on the app would be to ask students, the "customers", what they'd want to see on the app.</p>

      <b><p>Software (Development) Engineer:</p></b>
      <p>Software engineers work with the rest of their team to analyze the customer's/user's needs and then design and develop software to meet those needs. In our ISP, the software engineer/engineers will have to work with the rest of the team to create an app that students and staff at Allen High School will be able to install and use to order their food in the cafeteria. One problem they might run into would be processing the payments for the thousands of people that order food from the school everyday, as well as running servers to hold the information that goes through the app. In this case we'd have to work with some Allen High School staff as there are limitations we might not be able to get passed ourselves.</p>

      <b><p>QA Engineer:</p></b>
      <p>Quality assurance engineers watch every phase of the software development to make sure the code and product are up to the standards they have predetermined. Prior to starting the development of the product, they will come up with requrements for the product's quality. During the development, QA engineers must test the product and find any bugs that might have been missed before. In our ISP, the QA engineer is going to be very important. This app is going to be taking care of lunch for students and staff, and is therefore going to be dealing with money. Any minor bugs in the code could make a big mess, so testing and assuring the quality of our app will be necessary. I think I would have trouble in this position because I tend to get confused when reading other people's code. I think a way for me to fix this for myself and for other people would be to requre our code to have good comments. This will be very helpful in clarifying certain pieces of code that I didn't work on or don't understand.</p>

      <b><p>Release Engineer:</p></b>
      <p>Release engineers are in charge of overseeing the proper placement and delivery of source code into programs. They also must make sure the code enters a repository and can be duplicated and distributed. Again, since our ISP is dealing with thousands of students, the deployment of our code is very important. The release engineer for our ISP must make sure our product is properly released to the play store on all devices so that everyone has access to the app. I think this would be one of the hardest positions for me to be in becuase I have never released anything to the play store. This would take me a lot of time to figure out and I would have to do a lot of research to figure out the right way to go about it.</p>
