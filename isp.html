    <p><h3 id="p">Concept</h3></p>
    <p id="p">For my ISP project I made a word search. The word search scrambled every time you refreshed the page, it<br>
      had letters that could be clicked on, and a counter that tracked how many words you found. This allowed the game to <br>
      be played multiple times with different outcomes.</p>
    
    <p><h3 id="p">Motivation</h3></p>
    <p id="p">I decided to make a word search because it was one of the games I played the most on my phone when I was<br>
      younger. Being able to make my own version of one of my most frequently played games was very fun and rewarding in a way.</p>

    <p><h3 id="p">Code Segments</h3></p>
    <p id="p">The "onEntityMouseClick" function takes the x and y coordinates of the point at which you clicked.<br>
      It then takes the coordinate point and finds what letter is stored on the word search grid at that point.<br>
      Finally, it highlights the letter you clicked on. This code creates the 15 x 15 2D array. The array is made of<br>
      blank characters so that later on in the code the blank characters can be replaced with letters. This function<br>
      goes through the grid and checks if each spot is blank. If the spot is blank, it places a random letter from the<br>
      alphabet and moves on to the next. If the spot already has a letter stored in it, it moves on to the next. Before<br>
      this function runs, a function to randomly place words on the grid is run.</p>
    
    
    <p><h3 id="p">Conclusion</h3></p>
    <p id="p">The finished game ended up working and was playable, but there were definitely parts that could be improved.<br>
      One part that could be fixed would be the selecting system. Because of time constraints, I wasn't able to make it to <br>
      where you could click and drag to select a word. Instead, you have to click each individual letter in the word you <br>
      want to check. Once you have a whole word selected, you press the letter "s" on your keyboard to check the selected word<br>
      against the key. Another idea I didn't get to add was a randomized word bank. With additional time, I would've added more <br>
      words to the word bank and then randomized the words that got chosen. The final part that could be improved is the word bank<br>
      that is displayed on the players screen. When you find a word in the game, the word turns green on the word search but <br>
      doesn't get crossed out from the word bank. With additional time, I would've added that feature into the game.</p>
